# 🚀 X++ Learning Journey – My First Step into Dynamics AX Development

As I prepared for an interview that involved X++ — a language I had never touched before — I decided to dive in headfirst and build my understanding from scratch. This repository is my learning journal where I explored, practiced, and debugged my way through the **fundamentals of X++**.

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

X++ is a niche yet powerful language used in Microsoft Dynamics AX. Since it was new to me, I wanted to:

- 📚 Build a foundation in X++ with real code, not just theory
- 🔍 Document my learning mistakes and fixes like a real developer
- 💡 Continue learning beyond the interview — because I enjoy it

## ✨ What’s Inside

- ✅ Basic syntax (variables, loops, conditionals)
- ✅ Full coverage of OOP principles in X++:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
- ✅ Self-debugged code blocks with simulated compiler feedback
- 🧩 Final OOP mini-project: Vehicle simulation
- 🔁 Continuous updates as I learn more (collections, exceptions, etc.)
